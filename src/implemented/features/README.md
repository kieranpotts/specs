# Features

This section documents the user-facing features and behaviours of the current production system.

Features are organised by user roles. Because of the role hierarchy – in which privileges and permissions are inherited – features are defined once only, for the lowest-order user type hat has access to the feature. Thus, the features defined for Authenticated Users are available to all other user types.

We mostly use Gherkin notation to define the system's functions.
