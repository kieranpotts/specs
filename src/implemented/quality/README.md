# Quality attributes

A software system's quality attributes are its non-functional and performance-related features and requirements. For example, if a system needs to support 10,000 concurrent users, that is a non-functional requirement. Other examples of non-functional requirements include:

- Security protocols.
- Backup and redundancy systems.
- Compatibility with other platforms.
- Minimum response or data transfer times.
- Cost of modifying and extending functionality.

Non-functional requirements place constraints on the design of a software system, and on the components and tools that can be used in its construction and deployment.
