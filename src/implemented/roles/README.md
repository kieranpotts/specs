# User roles

End users often have different "stories" or "journeys" that they follow when they navigate through a software system. For example, some users may not have the necessary permissions or privileges to access some functions.

It is important to fully understand the various user roles in a software system, as even the slightest differences in the required business logic between users can have a significant impact on a system's architecture and the build effort. The different types of user are derived from the domain model.

This section will profile the different types of end users who interact with the [PROJECT_NAME] software system.

There is a hierarchy of roles. The features available to Authenticated Users, for example, are inherited by all other user types.

- **Anonymous User**
- **Authenticated User**
