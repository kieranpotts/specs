# Implemented Software Specifications

The contents of this directory define the functional and non-functional attributes of the current production system "as is". The software specification has five main sections:

- **[Overview](overview.md)** \
  A high-level overview of the problem space and how [PROJECT_NAME] solves it.

- **[Entities](entities)** \
  The different categories of information that are stored in the system, and how each entity type relates to others.

- **[User Roles](users)** \
  Profiles of the different types of end users who interact with the system.

- **[Features](features)** \
  The functions available to each user type.

- **[Quality Attributes](quality)** \
  Non-functional attributes, which place constraints on how the software is built.
