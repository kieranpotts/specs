# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

This source code repository encapsulates the software requirements and specifications for [PROJECT NAME]. Both functional and non-functional requirements (such as performance and security) are covered.

Business requirements turn into implemented software specifications through the following life cycle:

- **Stage 1: [Proposals](./src/proposals)** \
  New business requirements are solicited and documented here.

- **Stage 2: [Accepted](./src/accepted)** or **[rejected](./src/rejected)** \
  When finalised, proposals are evaluated for their costs and benefits, and then either accepted or rejected for development.

- **Stage 3: [Implemented](./src/implemented)** \
  This section describes the current production system "as is".

- **Stage 4: [Deprecated](./src/deprecated)** \
  Over time, some features may be removed or superseded by others.

See [the documentation](./docs) for instructions to write software proposals, and to manage software requirements through the design and implementation process.
